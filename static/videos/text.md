## RDT Inference Video Samples

### Dexterity

The following videos show that RDT can perform dexterous manipulation tasks. It must push the joystick straight enough to make the robot dog move **straight** forward, otherwise the robot dog will deviate.

```
放1.mp4即可
```

### Unseen Object

The following videos show that RDT can **zero-shot** generalize to unseen objects.

```
排列2,3,4.mp4,每行2个
```

### Instruction Following

The following videos show that RDT can stick to users' instructions and **zero-shot** generalize to unseen instructions (RDT has only seen the instructions for little, half, and full water levels).

```
排列5,6.mp4,每行2个
```

```
下面一行排列1.png和2.png，caption为：
“
Resulting water levels for 8 trails. Left: pouring water with the left hand, specifying the water level as one-third; Right: pouring water with the right hand, specifying the water level as two-thirds.
”
```

### Unseen Scene

The following videos show that RDT can **zero-shot** generalize to unseen scenes.

```
排列7-10.mp4,每行2个
```

### Few-Shot Learning

The following videos show that RDT can learn new skills with just a few demonstrations.

```
排列11-12.mp4,每行2个
```
